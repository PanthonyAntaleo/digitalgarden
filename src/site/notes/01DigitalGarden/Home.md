I'm a sys admin, reader, and writer with many interests. 

There is no grand purpose behind this site besides sharing things I'm working on, hosting notes on different technologies that I use like [[PowerShell Scripts\|PowerShell Scripts]], and various notes about topics including [[life\|life]]. It will change and update.

What I am working on now:
- [**Dungeons & Deliveries - A Post Apocalypse Comedy Adventure** (Book)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/110894/dungeons-deliveries-a-post-apocalypse-comedy-adventure)
- [[PowerShell Scripts\|PowerShell Scripts]] (to be built out)

This site is built with the [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plug in and Netlify. It is a cheap (free) way to host notes.
